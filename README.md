# Specific Aim

The Administrative core aims to support the program internally, coordinate the community externally, and provide overarching guidance to the strategically themed cores. 

# Research Strategy

### Communications

- Implement new organizational structure that has community and internal coordination strategies
- Develop corresponding slack, email lists, and meeting schedules that are aligned to the new organizational structure
- Develop project management strategies that push information rather than depending on verbal communications
- Include NCATS, Operations, and Hub members in as many contexts as possible
- Create internal homepage with all relevant links, and weekly mailer of activities and deadlines

### Engagement

- All projects are required to have a hub engagement plan and include hub members; Admin core will help projects and cores decide how to best engage, make connections, and support tracking and communications
- Coordinate new governance and project prioritization process that better enables the community to make suggestions for projects, to be coordinated, and to determine how CD2H resources will be spent. 
- Hire a web developer to implement a more suitable and engaging website that works well with Github projects and with other third party apps.
- Hire an Engagement Officer, write an engagement plan, Twitter, newsletters, coordination with CLIC, etc.
- Plan and coordinate hub visits
- Leverage DREAM IDEA competition to engage hubs that don’t “win” to do projects with us (we did have 25 hubs participate!)
- Create a library of slides/PR materials for use by team members

### Work Tracking

Implement and manage Github repos for each project to use for their work, with clearly defined deliverables, milestones, and tickets
Implement and manage dashboards that have overview views of progress, provide notifications, and support community involvement
Implement and manage improved project management of people, using onboarding forms and person classification
Implement a dashboard view for the website so that our community can see what we are doing, hold us accountable, and participate more readily
Document deliverables with clear descriptions of what constitutes delivery

### Content management

- Clean up the documents that we have, archiving a lot of them. Set up processes to be collect-and-reuse/update.
- Provide training for operations team members (see MTIP training materials, for example).  Send out instructions to navigate and best practices for future. 
- Create places for people to put things. Put more project work in Github.

### Demonstrated value

- The cores aim to deliver end-to-end solutions in strategic areas. Together, a multi-PI and site PI will be responsible for coordinating each core and for the success of the projects in their core. 
- The value of each project will be assessed as part of the evaluation plan for each project and will include community coordination and impact. Overarching indicators (such as number of community members involved) will be captured by the Admin core.
